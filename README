 NanoQplus (Shortly, Nano OS) is an operating system for Low-power and 
Lossy Networks (LLNs) applications. Nano OS is a new multi-threaded, light-
weight and low power sensor network operating system integrated with a general
-purpose single-board hardware platform to enable flexible and rapid 
prototyping of WSN.

Currently, Nano OS supports the following chracteristics.
 - Code optimization by reconfiguring modules
 - A variety of example codes for Nano OS modules
 - Easy-to-coding style in programming with 'C'
 - Various samples for lowpower modes

 To learn how to install and use Nano OS, please refer to the 'doc' directory. 
After installation, given below are short description of writing an application 
and downloading the application image into a wireless sensor node.

  (1) Prepare a directory for your application (e.g. mkdir blink)
  (2) Move to that directory (e.g. cd blink)
  (3) Create 'Makefile' in your application directory to include the 
      '$NOS_HOME/Makefile.kconf'.
      (e.g. echo "-include $(NOS_HOME)/Makefile.kconf" > Makefile)
  (4) Select Nano OS modules for your application by typing 'make menuconfig', 
      which will create 'kconf.h' file (e.g. make menuconfig) 
  (5) Write your own application in C (e.g. vi blink.c)
      The format of Nano OS applications is given below.

  #include "nos.h" 

  void main()
  {
    nos_init();  
	
    .........
    YOUR CODE HERE
    .........
  }

  (6) Compile & Link by typing 'make clean' and 'make', which creates a 
      hexa-formated file (*.rom or *.hex).
  (7) Download the hexa-formated file into a specific sensor board by typing 
      'make burn port=<port_class>', where <port_class> is one of the following 
      port class, [com1|com2|...|com*|tty*|usbasp].
